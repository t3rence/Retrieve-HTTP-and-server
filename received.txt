<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd><p>Some of the pages on this site include frames and/or JavaScript 
applications. These pages are written to be as universal as possible, and 
will work with multiple types of browsers. Netscape has been discontinued 
and is no longer supported, although existing copies are still in use and 
will work fine. As a replacement, I recommend
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>. For those 
thrill-seeking individuals who prefer the security risks of Internet 
Explorer, IE4 and later will also handle the interactions currently in 
use. This site will never attempt to exploit the security holes offered by 
IE, but we do feel you should be aware of the hazard.</p>

<p>Other browsers, such as Opera, generally emulate one or the other, and 
should not present any problems.</p>

<dt><b><a href="/digital/">The Logical Story</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Digital logic is at the core of all digital computers, and yet it
is entirely based on three fundamental operations, designated AND, OR, and
NOT. See how it's possible in these pages.</p>

<p>These pages now include coverage of the major
<a href = "/digital_electronics/">logic families</a> as well as some
<a href = "/digital_experiments/">practical experiments</a> that you can
perform with real components to see for yourself how they work.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some interactions require Javascript 1.1 or later. 
Incompatible browsers will be limited to a static 
presentation.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/analog/">Operational Amplifiers and Analog
Computers</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Analog computers are not completely gone from the scene, in spite
of the tremendous advances made in the digital field. And operational
amplifiers (op amps) are used in many more applications than analog
computers. Here is an overview of many applications for op amps, in and
out of analog computers.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p>

<p>These pages now include some <a href = "/analog_experiments/">practical
experiments</a> that you can perform with real components to see for
yourself how they work.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/dc_theory/">Electronic Theory: Direct
Current</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Now that we have begun looking at both digital and analog
circuitry, it is only appropriate to start looking at the components that
make up these circuits, and to explore their properties. We begin this
process here, with the fundamental properties of electronic components and
the basic rules by which they operate in electronic
circuits.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/ac_theory/">Electronic Theory: Alternating
Current</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Even the most basic electrical components can behave differently
for changing voltages than they do for steady voltages. Here we look as
the AC properties of the basic components, and the resulting variations in
circuit behavior.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/oscillators/">Oscillators</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>We've talked about alternating voltages and currents, and the AC 
properties of various electronic components. But how do we create those AC 
signals to apply to these components? Here is the bare beginnings of 
circuits designed to generate such signals over a wide range of 
frequencies.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/optics/">Take a look at optics</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Light is a very interesting topic. Is it a wave? A particle? Why is
the sky blue? How does a laser work? And what's this about &quot;light
pipes&quot; that let light travel around corners and into impossible
places? Some of the development work on this site is aimed at exploring
these and other questions about light.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>

<br	clear = "all" />

<dt><b><a href="/semiconductors/">What's inside these
semiconductors</a>?</b></dt>

<dd><p>I've been getting queries about the internal structure and behavior
of semicondutor devices. In response, here's a discussion of what
semiconductors are, how they behave, and how various semiconductor devices
are constructed.</p>

<p>Another set of pages, currently under development, will show the
behavior of typical semiconductor devices in actual, working
circuits.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>

<dt><b><a href="/computers/">Looking inside the computer</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Did you ever wonder what goes on inside that (mostly) featureless
box that you're now using to view this page? How is it that gazillions of
invisibly small things called "electrons" can figure out where to go and
what to do to paint words and pictures on your computer monitor or TV
screen? It obviously works since you are seeing the result, but
<i>how</i>? And probably the most important question in most people's
minds: "Can I do it, too?"</p>

<p>Well, the answer is, "Yes, you can, and it's not even all that hard."
It is my intention to help you learn for yourself what is going on behind
the scenes and how you can use it for your own purposes. I am in the
process of building a set of sample lesson pages on computers and the
people who work with them in various capacities; you can see them in
progress by going to this link.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>


<dt><b><a href="/htmltest/">Testing HTML markup</a>.</b></dt>

<dd><p>Have you considered writing your own HTML pages, but were unsure of
how to get started? Here's a chance to write and test HTML markup, style
sheet specifications, and even Javascript if you like, and to see the
results without having to shift back and forth between different
programs.</p>

<p>This interactive page uses both frames and
Javascript.<sub>&nbsp;</sub></p></dd>

<p>This Website is intended for those intrepid individuals who, for
whatever reason, find themselves looking for a less than formal approach
to useful education in a number of technical fields. Unlike the
University-based courses which I have found on the Internet, the "lessons"
provided here will be available to anyone at any time, and at no cost.
They also will involve no formal college credit.</p>

<p>To avoid getting caught by changes in this site, and to be sure you
know about changes as they occur, please be sure to set a bookmark only to
this home page -- I can promise that it will always be here as long as
this site exists. Other pages may be moved or renamed for logistical
reasons, but you will always be able to get there from here.</p>

<p>All material on this site will be designed and enhanced for Netscape
Navigator version 3.0 or higher, and compatible browsers. They may at any
time use both frames and JavaScript to provide an interactive means of
learning on your own. If your browser does not support frames and
JavaScript as well as forms, you may not be able to make full use of these
lessons. We're not trying to exclude anybody, but as long as the
&quot;browser wars&quot; go on (probably forever), we can't be all
things to all people. We'll do our best.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tests have shown that IE4 and higher can also handle the
current interactions in the digital logic section.</p>

physics, chemistry, math, computer operation/repair/programming,
electronics, or optics, please send an E-note indicating your interest to:
